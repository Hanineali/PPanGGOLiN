A U-shaped plot is a figure presenting the number of families (y axis) per number of organisms (x axis).
It is a .html file that can be opened with any browser and with which you can interact, zoom, move around, mouseover to see numbers in more detail, and you can save what you are seeing as a .png image file.

It can be generated using the 'draw' subcommand as such : 

`ppanggolin draw -p pangenome.h5 --ucurve`

```{image} ../_static/u_plot.png
:align: center
```
