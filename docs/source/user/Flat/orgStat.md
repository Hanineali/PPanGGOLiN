The organisms_statistics.tsv file is a tab-separated file describing the content of each of the genome used for building the pangenome. It might be useful when working with fragmented data such as MAGs or if you suspect some of your genomes to be chimeric, or to not belong to your taxonomic group (as those genomes will be outliers regarding to the numbers in this file).
The first lines starting with a '#' are indicators of parameters used when generating the numbers describing each organisms, and should not be read if loading this into a spreadsheet. They will be skipped automatically if you load this file with R.

This file is made of 15 columns described in the following table

| completeness           | This is an indicator of the proportion of single copy markers in the persistent that are present in the genome. While it is expected to be relatively close to 100 when working with isolates, it may be particularly interesting when working with very fragmented genomes as this provide a *de novo* estimation of the completess based on the expectation that single copy markers within the persistent should be mostly present in all individuals of the studied taxonomic group |
| nb_single_copy_markers | This indicates the number of present single copy markers in the genomes. They are computed using the parameter duplication_margin indicated at the beginning of the file. They correspond to all of the persistent gene families that are not present in more than one copy in 5% (or more) of the genomes by default.                                                                                                                                                                  |

It can be generated using the 'write' subcommand as such : 

`ppanggolin write -p pangenome.h5 --stats`

This command will also generate the 'mean_persistent_duplication.tsv' file.
